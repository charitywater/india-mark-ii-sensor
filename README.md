# charity: water - India Mark II

The software in this repository was developed and designed for the India Mark II handpump sensor for Charity Water. This sensor will expand the number of wells compatible with Charity Waterâ€™s IOT platform to include the India Mark II handpump. This sensor has the ability to monitor water flow on the IM2 handpump along with number of strokes and stroke length.  Ultimately, the goal is to start to get to a "predictive maintenance" solution for communitities to prevent wells breaking down and being unusable.
